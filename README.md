#####1. 
Programming incorporates so much of what I am passionate about. I was in a puzzle store, chatting with another customer about our mutual love of 3D puzzles, when he asked me why I don’t do what he does for a living--coding. He described it as it’s own very complex sort of puzzle, but unlike the “Bamboozler” puzzles we had been perusing in the store, there could be innumerable solutions.

The idea that coding could be more fun than a Rubik’s cube struck me as a highly dubious claim, but prompted me to begin downloading coding Apps on my phone, and playing with them in my spare time. It didn’t take long before I realized the incredible capacity for creativity, not just in the finished product, but in the _process_ of programming itself. Programming could be an application for my creative skills, and simultaneously a challenge to my spatial reasoning capacity—_the dream_! I find this prospect very exciting, so I have since been playing with resources online, following tutorials, and trying to learn as much as possible. Admittedly, free-time exploration through these resources and those provided on Ada’s website is pretty much the extent of my exposure. 

I am a quick and motivated learner, however, and believe that if admitted to the program, I could independently prepare myself to begin classes. Once a student in the program, I would be _intensely_ dedicated. My work ethic, I believe, would compensate for any deficits in prerequisite skills.

While I love my current job, I feel like could be putting my creative skills to better use.
In five years, I would hope that my career could serve society in influential ways, 
and that the day-to-day work would be a perpetual cognitive challenge to me.
In terms of serving society, it’s difficult to say specifically how this might look—
I can envision many applications for programming that would serve causes that I care about. 
To cite one possible idea, I would find it incredible to have the skills to couple programming prowess with my 
artistic training, to generate powerfully artful and effective promotional materials and communication
platforms for organizations such as Planned Parenthood or the Anti-Defamation League.

Some of my freelance and volunteer work has involved creating educational and promotional materials,
but I have been limited by my skills.
In five years, I hope to be employed in the tech industry, unrestricted by any lack of skills!

Being a gay Jewish woman, inclusivity is of profound importance to me. 
I was taught from an early age the dangers of exclusivity, especially that under the name anti-Semitism.
From subtle institutional bigotry, to seemingly harmless racist jokes, 
discrimination creates invisible barriers and dehumanizes people, and every act compounds on the last.
Particularly in light of the current political climate, when the president of the United States is fervently
seeking to bar a vulnerable religious minority from the country, I feel compelled to help combat intolerance.

If admitted to the program, I hope that the opportunities and skills afforded by Ada would render me better poised to do so.
I aspire to build a career that mirrors the heart of Ada’s mission for inclusivity and equal opportunity.

Several years ago, Jake, my nice-Jewish-boyfriend of six years, proposed… and I said yes.
This was really the culmination of a series of regrettable decisions, but I remember it as my _biggest ever_ mistake.
Immediately, that gorgeous ring wore like a horcrux.
I wanted to make Jake happy, to make my family happy, and most of all,
to continue to deny to myself the reason why I would never be compatible with him, or any other man.

It turns out, you can’t will yourself to be straight. 
Simultaneously calling off my engagement, and coming out to everyone as gay, felt like digging myself out of a hole
that I had been aggressively drilling into since puberty. Worst of all, it was a hole that poor Jake had fallen in with me.

While of course I would never make precisely that mistake again, (I am now fully aware and proud of being so completely gay)
the error of letting of denial, social pressure, shame, and other petty forces override one’s better judgment, 
is easy to unknowingly do. Through my mistake, I learned the _incredible_ importance of openness, honesty, 
and sincerity--to others, and especially to oneself! 

Hence, my propensity to divulge this sort of highly personal story, when perhaps your question is really just trying to guage 
how adept I might be at recognizing and correcting programming errors! 
If so, I can say that I am definitely one to enjoy the puzzle of identifying problems, and finding soultions!
