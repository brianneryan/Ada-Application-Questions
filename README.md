While I love my current job, I feel like could be putting my creative skills to better use.
In five years, I would hope that my career could serve society in influential ways, 
and that the day-to-day work would be a perpetual cognitive challenge to me.
In terms of serving society, it’s difficult to say specifically how this might look—
I can envision many applications for programming that would serve causes that I care about. 
To cite one possible idea, I would find it incredible to have the skills to couple my 
artistic training with programming prowess, to generate powerfully artful and effective promotional materials and communication
platforms for organizations such as Planned Parenthood or the Anti Defamation League.

Some of my freelance and volunteer work has involved creating educational and promotional materials,
but I have been limited by my skills.
In five years, I hope to be employed in the tech industry, unrestricted by any lack of skills!

Being a gay Jewish woman, inclusivity is of profound importance to me. 
I was taught from an early age the dangers of exclusivity, especially that under the name anti-Semitism.
From subtle institutional bigotry, to seemingly harmless racist jokes, 
discrimination creates invisible barriers and dehumanizes people, and every act compounds on the last.
Particularly in light of the current political climate, when the president of the United States is fervently
seeking to bar a vulnerable religious minority from the country, I feel compelled to help combat intolerance.

If admitted to the program, I hope that the opportunities and skills afforded by Ada would render me better poised to do so.
I aspire to build a career that mirrors the heart of Ada’s mission for inclusivity and equal opportunity.

Several years ago, Jake, my nice-Jewish-boyfriend of six years, proposed… and I said yes.
This was really the culmination of a series of regrettable decisions, but I remember it as my _biggest ever_ mistake.
Immediately, that gorgeous ring wore like a horcrux.
I wanted to make Jake happy, to make my family happy, and most of all,
to continue to deny to myself the reason why I would never be compatible with him, or any other man.

It turns out, you can’t will yourself to be straight. 
Simultaneously calling off my engagement, and coming out to everyone as gay, felt like digging myself out of a hole
that I had been aggressively drilling into since puberty. Worst of all, it was a hole that poor Jake had fallen in with me.

While of course I would never make precisely that mistake again, (I am now fully aware and proud of being so completely gay)
the error of letting of denial, social pressure, shame, and other petty forces override one’s better judgment, 
is easy to unknowingly do. Through my mistake, I learned the _incredible_ importance of openness, honesty, 
and sincerity--to others, and especially to oneself! 

Hence, my propensity to divulge this sort of highly personal story, when perhaps your question is really just trying to guage 
how adept I might be at recognizing and correcting programming errors! 
If so, I can say that I am definitely one to enjoy the puzzle of identifying problems, and finding soultions!
